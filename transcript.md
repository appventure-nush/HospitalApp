# Anaphylaxis

## Refractory hypotension, acute altered mental status, shock, ischemic chest discomfort or acute heart failure

#### **Stop** and remove all potential causative agents.

- Including chlorhexidine impregnanted catheters, colloids, latex.

#### Call for help and e-Trolley; note the time.

- Ask who will be the crisis manager.

#### Maintain and secure airway; use 100% oxygen.

- Intubate if airway oedema or potential respiratory compromise

#### Give IV Crystalloids fast ({20} ml); repeat as required.

- Consider IV Adrenaline infusion if repeated boluses required (i.e. severe hypotension or bronchospasm)
- **Refractory hypotension:** Continue Adrenaline and IV fluid bolus {50} ml
- Consider insertion of IA/CVP lines; Consider TTE to assess filling 

#### Obtain labelled blood samples.

- Mast cell tryptase, FBC, coagulation screen, electrolytes, +/- ABG 

#### Post-crisis management

- Consider adjunctive therapy when haemodynamically stable
- Monitor closely for 6 hours, up to 24H ICU/HD if mod-severe 
   (up to 20% incidence of biphasic reaction)
- Reprint AIMS chart on expanded time scale
- Refer Allergist (using template in Anaphylaxis Guidelines)
- Update Citrix of suspected allergen. 
- Refer Anaphylaxis Management Guidelines on ANA dept website

# Asystole/Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA)

## Non-shockable pulseless cardiac arrest

#### Call for help and E-trolley

- **Ask:** "Who will be the crisis manager?"
- **Say:** "The top priority is high-quality CPR"

#### Commence CPR (100 compressions/min)

# Bradycardia - Unstable

#### Call for help and E-trolley

- Ask: “Who will be the crisis manager?”

#### Turn Fi O<sub>2</sub> to 100%

- Verify oxygenation/ventilation adequate 

#### Give atropine

#### Stop surgical stimulation (if laparoscopy, desufflate)

#### If atropine ineffective:

- Start adrenaline or dopamine infusion
- *Or* start transcutaneous pacing 

#### Consider…

- Turning off volatile anaesthetics if patient remains unstable
- Calling for expert consultation e.g. Electrophysiologist 
- Assessing for drug induced causes e.g. beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin
- Cardiology consultation if myocardial infarction suspected e.g. ECG changes

## Drug Doses and Treatments

#### Atropine

- 0.6 mg IV, may repeat up to 2.4 mg total

#### Adrenaline

## Transcutaneous Pacing Instructions

1. Place pacing electrodes front and back.
2. Connect 3-lead ECG from pacing defibrillator to patient
3. Turn monitor/defibrillator to **pacer** mode
4. Set **pacer rate** (ppm) to 80/min (adjust based on clinical response once pacing is established)
5. Start to 60mA of **pacer output** and increase until electrical capture (pacer spikes aligned with QRS complexes)
6. Set final milliamperes 10mA above initial capture level
7. Confirm effective capture 
   - Electrically: Assess ECG tracing
   - Mechanically: Palpate femoral pulse (carotid pulse unreliable)

# Difficult Airway: Needle Cricothyroidotomy

## Rescue technique for “can’t intubate, can’t ventilate” situation to buy time before definite airway

#### Call for expert anaesthesiology and/or ENT specialist, E-trolley & Difficult Airway Cart 

- Ask: “Who will be the crisis manager?”

#### Identify cricothyroid membrane

- If anatomy not palpable, consider surgical cricothyroidotomy with blunt dissection using scalpel-bougie-tube technique (ALGORITHM 6)

#### Use Insyte 14G or Ravussin needle-catheter connected to 5ml syringe with normal saline

- Stab over midpoint of cricothyroid membrane, at an angle 45-60° to the skin, in a caudad direction
- On aspiration of air into 5ml syringe, advance 2mm and confirm aspiration of air again before advancing catheter over needle

#### Connect Rapid O<sub>2</sub> to auxiliary oxygen source on anaesthetic machine at 15L/min, and connect luer-lock end to catheter

## Equipment

Note: All equipment available in 2nd drawer of AU machine

- BD Insyte 14G cannula or VBM Ravussin catheter
- 5 ml syringe with normal saline
- Rapid O<sub>2</sub> set

## Use of Rapid O<sub>2</sub> (Jet oxygenation)

Note: This device can deliver 15L/min but at the expense of high airway pressure and risk of barotrauma 

#### Initial jet:

- Deliver 4 second oxygen jet by occluding thumb Y-piece 
- While administering
  1. Look for chest rise
  2. Ensure no excessive back pressure on thumb 

#### Wait for response: 

- Release occlusion and wait 20 seconds for SpO<sub>2</sub> to rise 
- DO NOT jet again unless 
  1. No initial rise in SpO<sub>2</sub> or 
  2. Drop in SpO<sub>2</sub> by 5% from maximum previously achieved from initial successful jet 

#### Subsequent jet: 2 seconds duration 

#### Wait for response for 20 seconds

- No SpO<sub>2</sub> response:  2 seconds jet 
- SpO<sub>2</sub> response: Repeat from Step 3 

## In all cases, once there has been successful oxygenation, early conversion to a definitive airway is required.

# Difficult Airway: Surgical Cricothyroidotomy

## Rescue technique for “can’t intubate, can’t ventilate” situation or failure of needle cricothyroidotomy 

#### Call for expert anaesthesiology and/or ENT specialist, E-trolley & Difficult Airway Cart 

- Ask: “Who will be the crisis manager?”

#### Identify cricothyroid membrane

#### Transverse stab incision through skin and membrane

#### Rotate scalpel blade 90° with sharp edge of blade pointing caudally, while maintaining traction towards the operator

#### Insert bougie into airway 

- Switch hands so that dominant hand now holds bougie, and non dominant hand maintains traction on blade 
- Use scalpel blade to guide insertion of bougie 

#### Advance ETT via bougie using rotational 360° technique 

- Inflate cuff and withdraw ETT till resistance is felt from inflated cuff abutting airway wall

#### Ventilate with low-pressure source

#### Verify tube position and pulmonary ventilation with EtCO<sub>2</sub>

## Equipment

- Scalpel – short and rounded (Size 10)
- Small (e.g. 6-7mm) cuffed tracheal tube **or** tracheostomy tube 
- Bougie

## If anatomy not palpable

- Make a 6-8cm midline vertical neck incision 
- With blunt finger dissection, separate the strap muscles to expose the trachea
- Cannula cricothyroidotomy can then be achieved under vision. 

## In all cases, once there has been successful oxygenation, early conversion to a definitive airway is required.

# Fire

## Evidence of fire (smoke, odour, flash) on patient, drapes or in patient’s airway 

#### Call for help, and activate fire alarm

- Ask: “Who will be the crisis manager?”
- Delegate: Get the fire extinguisher (Located along corridors)

#### Extinguish fire

- Remove drapes/flammable or smouldering material
- If non-electrical: Extinguish with saline or saline-soaked gauze
- If electrical equipment burning, use only CO<sub>2</sub> fire extinguisher (safe in wounds)
