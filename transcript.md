#### Initial jet:

- Deliver 4 second oxygen jet by occluding thumb Y-piece
- While administering
  1. Look for chest rise
  2. Ensure no excessive back pressure on thumb 

#### Wait for response: 

- Release occlusion and wait 20 seconds for SpO<sub>2</sub> to rise 
- DO NOT jet again unless 
  1. No initial rise in SpO<sub>2</sub> or 
  2. Drop in SpO<sub>2</sub> by 5% from maximum previously achieved from initial successful jet 

#### Subsequent jet: 2 seconds duration 

#### Wait for response for 20 seconds

- No SpO<sub>2</sub> response:  2 seconds jet
- SpO<sub>2</sub> response: Repeat from Step 3 

## In all cases, once there has been successful oxygenation, early conversion to a definitive airway is required.
